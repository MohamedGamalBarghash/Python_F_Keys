# Python_F_Keys
An app created to enable some of the function keys on windows without having to press the fn key on keyboard along with the function keys to function.

This simple app enables the volume keys, the mute key, as well as the brightness keys.

# Instructions to run properly:
1- Download the repo.  
2- Extract the zip attached and run the `f1_key_disable_help.reg` to disable the default `F1` key help functionality.  
3- Run the python code with `pythonw` from the terminal or the command prompt to run it in the background in windows.  

### NOTE:
- If you want to close the program after you run it in the background, just end the `Python` task from the `Task Manager`.
- All packages required to run the script are mentioned in the script itself and the comments above it contain the command required to install the packages with pip3.
